## Overview

The Kenya DHS MNCAH Equity Analysis is a public health data analysis project focused on maternal, newborn, child, adolescent, and household health indicators across Kenya’s 47 counties.

Using **Kenya DHS 2014 microdata**, I applied survey-weighted analysis in R to estimate county-level health indicators, generate confidence intervals, visualize subnational disparities, and prepare outputs for interactive Power BI reporting.

The project demonstrates how complex survey data can be transformed into decision-ready insights for health equity monitoring, county-level planning, and evidence-based public health decision-making.

## Tools

R | DHS Microdata | survey | srvyr | tidyverse | ggplot2 | sf | geodata | Power BI | Excel

## What I Did

- Loaded and cleaned Kenya DHS 2014 microdata for maternal, child, adolescent, household, and geographic analysis
- Applied DHS sampling weights and complex survey design methods in R
- Computed county-level estimates for MNCAH and household health indicators
- Generated 95% confidence intervals to show uncertainty around subnational estimates
- Produced county-level maps, ranking charts, equity gap visuals, and drill-down outputs
- Built Power BI dashboard pages to make the results easier to explore and communicate
- Exported structured outputs for reporting, visualization, and further analysis

## Project Workflow

```text
DHS microdata preparation
→ survey design specification
→ weighted indicator estimation
→ county-level confidence intervals
→ geospatial mapping
→ Power BI dashboard development
→ health equity insights
```

## Dashboard Overview

These dashboard pages present maternal health, child health, adolescent health, and household environmental indicators through county-level summaries and visual comparisons.

## Equity Analysis

The equity analysis page compares the best- and worst-performing counties for selected indicators, highlighting performance gaps that may be hidden when only national averages are reported.

## Key Findings

- National averages can hide major county-level differences in maternal, child, adolescent, and household health outcomes
- Survey weights are essential when analyzing DHS microdata to avoid biased estimates
- Confidence intervals help communicate uncertainty, especially for county-level estimates with smaller sample sizes
- Geospatial and dashboard-based visualization makes health inequalities easier to identify and communicate
- Equity gap analysis helps highlight counties and indicators requiring targeted policy attention
- County-level outputs support localized interpretation and planning

## Skills Demonstrated

- Complex survey data analysis using R
- DHS sample weighting and survey design specification
- County-level health indicator estimation
- Confidence interval estimation
- Data cleaning and transformation using tidyverse
- Geospatial mapping using sf, geodata, and ggplot2
- Power BI dashboard design and data storytelling
- Health equity and subnational disparity analysis
- Translating statistical outputs into decision-ready insights
