## Overview

Maji Ndogo is a story-driven data analysis project completed as part of the **ALX Africa Data Science programme**. The project is set in a fictional African nation facing a severe water access crisis.

Using a **60,000+ record MySQL database**, I analyzed water sources, field visits, employee records, water quality scores, locations, and an independent auditor report to identify infrastructure gaps, service delivery challenges, data quality issues, and corruption risks.

## Tools

SQL | MySQL | Python | Pandas | Jupyter Notebook | Power BI | Matplotlib

## What I Did

- Queried and explored a relational MySQL database containing water access and field survey data
- Cleaned employee records, standardized email addresses, and corrected formatting issues
- Analyzed water source types, population served, queue times, and geographic service gaps
- Used SQL joins, views, CTEs, aggregations, and window functions to rank infrastructure repair priorities
- Compared surveyor scores with independent auditor scores to detect data integrity issues
- Built a Power BI dashboard to communicate national, provincial, queue-time, and gender-related insights

## Dashboard Preview

The national dashboard summarizes water source distribution, population served, rural and urban patterns, and town-level differences across Maji Ndogo.

## Queue Analysis

This view highlights waiting time patterns by province, day of week, and hour of day, helping identify where service bottlenecks are most severe.

## Gender and Social Risk Insights

This dashboard explores gender-related patterns in water collection and water-related risks, showing how the burden of water access is unevenly distributed.

## Key Findings

* Many citizens rely on shared taps, rivers, wells, or broken home taps rather than reliable clean water at home
* Queue times at shared taps can become extremely long in high-burden locations
* Rural communities experience greater water access challenges than urban areas
* Women and children carry a disproportionate burden in water collection
* Independent audit comparisons revealed data quality issues and possible survey manipulation
* SQL-based ranking helped identify priority water sources for repair and infrastructure improvement

## Skills Demonstrated

* SQL querying, joins, views, CTEs, and window functions
* MySQL database analysis and cleaning
* Python-based analysis in Jupyter Notebook
* Data validation and audit comparison
* Infrastructure prioritization analysis
* Power BI dashboard design and storytelling
* Translating technical findings into decision-ready insights
