A selection of data science, analytics, and data engineering projects focused on public health, infrastructure, development data, and automated reporting.

## Maji Ndogo Water Access Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis project examining water access, infrastructure gaps, service delivery, and resource allocation in the fictional Maji Ndogo region.

The project uses structured data analysis and visual reporting to explore water source usage, access patterns, queue times, pollution issues, and operational inefficiencies affecting water service delivery.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Power BI

**Key focus areas:**

- Water access and source analysis
- Service delivery assessment
- Queue time and usage pattern analysis
- Pollution and water quality review
- Infrastructure and resource allocation insights

## Kenya DHS MNCAH Equity Analysis

A subnational health equity analysis using Kenya DHS 2014 microdata to examine maternal, newborn, child, adolescent, and household health indicators across Kenya’s 47 counties.

The project applies complex survey methodology, survey weights, confidence intervals, county-level mapping, and geocovariate integration to support evidence-based public health decision-making.

**Tools:** R, `survey`, `srvyr`, `tidyverse`, `sf`, `geodata`, Power BI

**Key focus areas:**

- Maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health indicators
- Survey-weighted county-level estimation
- 95% confidence intervals
- Health equity and subnational disparities
- Choropleth mapping and Power BI dashboard outputs

## Human Capital Outcomes: Clustering & Prediction with World Bank Data

A machine learning-style Stata project using World Bank Development Indicators to explore, cluster, and predict survival to age 65 across country-year observations.

The project builds a reproducible Stata 15.1 SE workflow covering data cleaning, country-year panel construction, exploratory analysis, k-means clustering, regression-based prediction modeling, and model performance evaluation.

**Tools:** Stata 15.1 SE, World Bank Development Indicators, Regression Modeling, K-means Clustering, GitHub

**Key focus areas:**

- World Bank Development Indicators analysis
- Survival-to-age-65 prediction
- Country-year panel data preparation
- Regression-based prediction modeling
- K-means clustering of human development profiles
- RMSE and MAE model evaluation
- Regression parameter export and prediction outputs

## SDG Dataset Matcher

A data engineering pipeline that matches UN-DESA datasets to official SDMX Sustainable Development Goal indicators using automated text matching and similarity scoring.

The project reduces manual dataset reconciliation by extracting dataset names, querying the SDMX Registry API, applying fuzzy matching, assigning confidence levels, and exporting structured outputs for review and downstream use.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Requests, XML parsing, Fuzzy Matching, Jupyter Notebook

**Key focus areas:**

- Dataset ingestion and preprocessing
- SDG indicator matching
- SDMX Registry API integration
- Fuzzy matching and confidence scoring
- Reproducible output generation
